          <p className="text-gray-700">
            A <strong>Collective Noun</strong> refers to a word that represents a group of people, animals, or things considered as a single unit. It is a singular noun that denotes a collection of individuals or things.
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 text-sm space-y-2">
            <li>
              <strong>Examples:</strong> Team (a group of players), Family (a group of people related by blood), Herd (a group of animals), Class (a group of students)

          </ul>
        </div>
        <p className="text-gray-700">
          Collective nouns are used to refer to groups as a whole. For instance, a "team" can refer to a group of players, but the noun itself is singular, even though it refers to multiple people.
